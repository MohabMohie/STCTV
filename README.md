## I. Running some Tests üèÉ

- Navigate to the module that you want to play with. For example ```GUI_Web```
- Navigate to any test class. For example ```src/test/java/TestPackage/TestClass.java```
- Press the green play button next to the class name to run the entire class, or next to a test method to run only that
  method.
- Test execution will begin, and you'll see the browser opening and the test running.
- The Test execution report will open automatically in your default web browser after the test run is completed.
- You can open the detailed allure report by running the ```generate_allure_report``` executable in your project root
  directory.
